Good use of icons 
Good job with displaying the QR information before storing it
Having big fonts was a plus plus as it was easy to read
UI was very accessible
The demo should have been rehearsed collectively as a team
The app crashes in some scenarios
No search functionality was found
Some elements overlap the other, example generate code button overlaps the displayed name on the main screen
Overall, youâ€™ll did really good!
