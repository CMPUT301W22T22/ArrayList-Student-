Feedbacks were addressed appropriately
Good quality Code About Â½ of requirements implemented and mostly done
Some connectivity to server, however not alot of DB activites were seen
Try to add more test cases and give proper error messages 
Code is mostly clear, readable and checks for errors
Add information in readme as well however, the wiki page looks extremely helpful for 3rd party users
Make sure your project board highlights which stories are completed (in which state are they exactly)
Members are all present at each review which is a good thing
Improve a bit of your demo, meaning try practising the demo as you would be more confident because in some aspects I saw uncertainity 
Overall, good work!
